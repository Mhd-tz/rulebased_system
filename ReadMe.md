# A Hybrid Generative System

**Author:** Mahdi Taziki  
**Date:** Feb 12, 2026  

## Project Overview
This is a hybrid generative system that explores the intersection of semantic storytelling and procedural visual art. By combining a **Grammar-Based Text Generator** with a **Rule-Based L-System Visualizer**, the system creates a cohesive multimedia experience where the "fate" of the visual output is tied to the narrative theme.

This project is based on **Option 3: Hybrid System**.

## How to Run

1.  **Install the Library:**
    Run the following command in the first code cell of your notebook to install the required graphics library:
    ```python
    !pip install ColabTurtlePlus
    ```

2.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the main code cell containing the `run_assignment()` function.

3.  **Select a Mode:**
    When prompted, enter your choice:
    * Type `1` for **Mythic Mode** (Order/Nature).
    * Type `2` for **Nautical Mode** (Chaos/Storm).

4.  **View Output:**
    The system will print a unique 3-sentence story and draw the corresponding fractal immediately below the text.
